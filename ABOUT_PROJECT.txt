                                        ABOUT PROJECT
     Leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, particularly specialized in time series analysis, my approach delivered valuable insights for precise sales forecast
ing with the help of Power BI. This strategic methodology, coupled with interactive dashboard creation, proved instrumental in driving business success, providing real-
time visibility to over 4 KPIs and enabling informed decision-making. Data was divided into 4 regions, enhancing localized strategy development. One of the conclusions
was that 30% of payments were made online, highlighting shifts towards digital transactions. Additionally, significant conclusions were drawn about logistic management,
discount offers on cards, and demand and supply management.
